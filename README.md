# fu3e Developer Test

### Introduction

This is my completed F3 Group developer test.

All the changes are in the **andrew-richardson** branch, you can use this
to diff against **master** if you want to see exactly what I've changed.

### Setup

- `npm install && npm run watch`
- `php artisan serve --port=8085`
- Visit http://localhost:8085

### Test

I've implemented unit tests on the PHP side.

Run phpunit to run them.
